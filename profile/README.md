Celsira is revolutionizing the way private beaches operate and interact with their guests. By digitalizing the
management and reservation processes, Celsira provides an all-in-one solution for beach owners, while also enhancing the
customer experience for beachgoers. Celsima, the management tool within Celsira, empowers beach owners and their
employees to efficiently manage operations, from deck chair reservations, to customer analytics, reservations and payments.
